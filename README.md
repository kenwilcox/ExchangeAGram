Added Facebook Support - To remove compiler deprecated warnings go to the Pods-Facebook-iOS-SDK target, select build phases and double click on the offending file (Facebook.m and FBUserSettingsViewController.m) and add -Wno-deprecated-declarations to the compile flags. I don't care to fix deprecated warnings on third party code at this time.
